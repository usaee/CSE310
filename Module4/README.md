# Overview

With this project I am attempting to further my learning as a software engineer by learning
how to write web apps using Django and Python.

This web app allows a user to create a "to do" list using a local server.
This app allows the user to create "to do" items as well as delete "to do" items.

In order to start the local server, open a command prompt window and enter the
following commands:
pipenv shell
python manage.py runserver

In order to access the web app, open a web browser and type in the following
url: http://127.0.0.1:8000/todo/


My purpose for creating this project is to learn how to use Django for creating
web apps using Python.
