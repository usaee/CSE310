# Overview
With this project I am attempting to further my learning as a software engineer by learning
how to write web apps using Django and Python.

This web app allows a user to create a "to do" list using a local server.
This app allows the user to create "to do" items as well as delete "to do" items.

In order to start the local server, open a command prompt window and enter the
following commands:
* pipenv shell
* python manage.py runserver

In order to access the "to do" list web app, open a web browser and type in the following
url:
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/todo/

In order to access the "history" web app, open a web browser and type in the following
url:
* http://127.0.0.1:8000/history/

My purpose for creating this project is to learn how to use Django for creating
web apps using Python.

# Web Pages

* For the first page I created a "todo" page which is where the user is able to add or remove items from the displayed list.
* For the second page I created a "history" page which is where the user is able to see every item that was ever added to the "to do" list regardless of
  whether it was removed from the "to do" list or not.

# Development Environment

I used the Django python library to build this project.

The programming language used for this project was Python.

# Future Work

* Add a feature that allows the user to add a time for tasks to be completed by.
