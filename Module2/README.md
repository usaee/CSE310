# Overview

This project represents a very basic concept of an ATM machine.
The user is able to create their own account, add funds, withdrawl funds, and get a balance inquiry.

The purpose of this software is to help me become more familiar and experienced with C++.
I am learning how to use variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and STL data structures.
