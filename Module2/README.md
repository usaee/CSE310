# Overview

This project represents a very basic concept of an ATM machine.
The user is able to create their own account, add funds, withdrawl funds, and get a balance inquiry.

The purpose of this software is to help me become more familiar and experienced with C++.
I am learning how to use variables, expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, classes, and STL data structures.

{#C Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
