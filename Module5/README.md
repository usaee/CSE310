# Overview

This Java project is designed to simulate an ATM machine. The user is able to simulate functions such
as withdrawing and depositing funds. The user is also able to check the balance of their simulated account.

My purpose for writing this software is to become familiar with the Java programming language and gain experience.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

For this project I used Visual Studio Code (IDE) to develop the software.

The programming language that I used in this project was Java. I also used the "Scanner"
library in order to take user inputs.
